## Elevator Pitch

Wildfires and structural fires cause billions in damage, claim lives, and overwhelm emergency services every year. Current response systems rely on fragmented data, delayed satellite imagery, and manual coordination.

**SparkGuard** is a unified platform that ingests existing satellite-derived data (including CubeSat sources) and delivers AI-assisted decision support to emergency responders. Instead of raw data dumps, we generate structured **incident packages** — actionable briefs with location context, weather conditions, recommended response actions, and visual overlays — so teams can act faster and smarter.

Built for the **Upstart Competition (GCES Concordia)** under the themes of **Health & Wellness** and **Smart Systems**.

---

## Problem

### Why It Matters

- **Delayed detection**: Satellite revisit times can miss fast-moving fires; ground reports are often too late.
- **Fragmented data**: Weather, terrain, satellite imagery, and local intel exist in silos — responders must manually piece together situational awareness.
- **Information overload**: Raw feeds without interpretation slow decision-making during critical windows.

### Who Is Affected

| Stakeholder | Pain Point |
|-------------|------------|
| Fire departments | Incomplete scene intel before dispatch |
| Emergency managers | No unified view across data sources |
| Municipal governments | Reactive rather than preventive posture |
| Communities | Slower evacuations, prolonged smoke exposure |

### Real-World Constraints

- Emergency budgets are tight; solutions must leverage **existing infrastructure**.
- First responders need **simple outputs**, not dashboards requiring training.

---

## Solution Overview

SparkGuard is a **software platform** that:

1. **Ingests** publicly available and commercial satellite-derived data (thermal anomalies, hotspot feeds, imagery).
2. **Processes** incoming data through analytics pipelines to detect, classify, and contextualize fire events.
3. **Generates** structured incident packages with recommended actions, wind/weather context, and visual overlays.
4. **Distributes** packages to emergency services via configurable channels (email, SMS, webhook, exportable briefs).

### What the Prototype Demonstrates

- End-to-end data flow from ingestion to alert generation (simulated feeds).
- Dashboard UI for viewing active incidents and drilling into details.
- Sample incident package with recommended actions.

---

## Key Features

### 🛰️ Satellite Intelligence
- Ingest thermal anomaly and hotspot data from existing satellite feeds
- Support for CubeSat-class data sources with higher revisit frequencies
- Automated parsing of standard fire detection formats (e.g., FIRMS-compatible)

### 🧠 Decision Support
- AI-assisted interpretation of multi-source data
- Systematic querying of contextual databases (terrain, infrastructure, historical incidents)
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty flagging for human review

### 📊 Operations Dashboard
- Unified view of active and historical incidents
- Incident package generation and export
- Configurable alerting rules and distribution channels

## How It Works

**Step-by-step pipeline from data ingestion to dispatch:**

1. **Ingest** — Satellite feeds (thermal, imagery, hotspots)
2. **Normalize** — Align data formats, georeference, and timestamps
3. **Enrich** — Add weather/wind data, terrain, and infrastructure context
4. **Analyze** — AI models classify events, estimate severity, and predict spread
5. **Decide** — AI surfaces recommendations; human reviews and approves
6. **Dispatch** — Finalized incident package sent to responders

---

## Data Sources & Integrations

> *Examples of compatible data sources — actual feeds depend on availability and project scope.*

- **Fire/Hotspot Feeds**: Public satellite fire detection services
- **Satellite Imagery**: Earth observation providers (public and commercial)
- **Weather/Wind**: Standard weather APIs
- **Outputs**: Email/SMS alerts, exportable incident briefs, webhook integrations

---

## AI Decision Support

**What the AI does:**
- Detects and classifies fire events from multi-source data
- Estimates severity and potential spread
- Generates draft recommendations with confidence scores

**What humans decide:**
- Approval of incident packages before dispatch
- Override or adjust recommendations based on local knowledge
- Final dispatch authority always remains with emergency personnel

> **Human-in-the-loop**: AI recommendations are advisory only. Low-confidence events are flagged for manual review. Humans retain full decision authority.

---

## Prototype Scope

**What's included:**
- Dashboard UI (clickable mockup / functional prototype)
- Sample incident package with mock data
- Alerting interface designs

**What's simulated:**
- Satellite data feeds (using sample/historical data)
- AI model outputs (demonstration mode)

> *Prototype demonstrates end-to-end concept and UX — not production-grade systems.*

---

## Impact & Sustainability

### Health & Wellness

- **Faster response** = reduced injury and fatality risk for affected communities.
- **Reduced smoke exposure**: Earlier containment limits air quality degradation.
- **Responder safety**: Better intel before arrival reduces unknowns on scene.

### Sustainability

- **Prevention-oriented**: Early detection enables smaller, faster interventions.
- **Reduced burned area**: Limiting fire spread protects ecosystems and reduces carbon release.
- **Efficient resource allocation**: Targeted response avoids unnecessary deployments.

> *We do not claim specific metrics (hectares saved, emissions reduced) without validated data. Impact is projected based on faster detection-to-response cycles.*

---

## Business Model Snapshot

**Customer segments:**
- Municipal and regional fire departments
- Emergency management agencies
- Forestry and wildfire services
- Industrial operators in fire-prone areas

**Value proposition:**
- Unified situational awareness from fragmented data
- Actionable outputs tailored for responders
- Modular integration with existing systems

**Revenue options** *(under consideration)*: SaaS subscription, per-incident pricing, enterprise licenses

---

## Risks, Ethics, Privacy & Compliance

- **Privacy**: Configurable data retention; role-based access controls
- **Security**: Data encrypted in transit; authentication required for all access
- **Ethics**: AI is advisory only — humans retain full decision authority; system augments, not replaces, professional judgment

## Why This Is Feasible

SparkGuard is designed around **existing, accessible infrastructure**:

1. **Public satellite data is available today** — NASA FIRMS, Sentinel, and others provide free or low-cost fire detection feeds.
2. **Modular integrations** — the platform connects to external systems via standard APIs and export formats, minimizing custom development.
3. **AI is assistive, not autonomous** — we use proven classification techniques with human oversight, avoiding regulatory and liability complexity of fully autonomous systems.

The core innovation is **integration and interpretation** — bringing fragmented data into a unified view and translating it into actionable guidance for responders.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Lekerj/SparkGuard.git
cd SparkGuard
npm install

# 2. Create your .env file (optional — app works without it using mock data)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

### Adding Your NASA FIRMS API Key (Optional — Free)

The app runs perfectly with mock data. To enable **live wildfire data**:

1. **Create a free NASA Earthdata account** at https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new
2. **Request a MAP_KEY** at https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/area/
3. **Paste the key** into your `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_NASA_FIRMS_MAP_KEY=your_map_key_here
   ```
4. **Restart the dev server** — the globe will now show real satellite fire detections.

> **Limits:** Completely free (not a trial). ~10 requests/minute rate limit. Data updates every ~3 hours from NASA VIIRS/MODIS satellites.
